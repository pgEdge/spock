# Installing and Configuring the Spock Extension

The Spock extension can be installed with pgEdge Postgres or built from source.

## Installing Spock with pgEdge Distributed or Enterprise Postgres

The latest Spock extension is automatically installed and created with any [pgEdge Distributed or Enterprise Postgres](https://docs.pgedge.com/) installation. A pgEdge deployment provides quick and easy access to:

*  the latest minor version of your preferred Postgres version.
*  Spock [functions and procedures](spock_functions/index.md).
*  [ACE (the Active Consistency Engine) consistency monitoring](https://docs.pgedge.com/platform/ace).
*  [Snowflake sequences](https://docs.pgedge.com/platform/snowflake).
*  pre-installed [pgBackRest](https://docs.pgedge.com/platform/managing/pgbackrest) for simplified backup and restore capabilities.
*  LOLOR large object support.
*  management tools for your active-active distributed cluster.

Spock is open-source and available for review at [Github](https://github.com/pgEdge).

!!! info
    pgEdge Postgres deployments also provide a simplified upgrade path so you can take advantage of important new features quickly and easily.

### Building the Extension from Source

Spock is available as an [open-source project](https://github.com/pgEdge/spock) that you can build from source code distributed at the Github project page.  The Spock extension must be built on a version-specific build of Postgres that is patched to provide 'hooks' so `spock` can access the Postgres engine. 

To patch the Postgres source code, download the source code from the [Postgres project](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/), and move into the source directory.  Then, clone the `spock` directory:

`git clone https://github.com/pgEdge/spock.git`

Then, apply the `.diff` files from the `spock/patches/version` directory that match your build version. To apply a patch, use the command:

  `patch -p1 < path_to_patch/patch_name`

After applying version-specific patches, you can configure, `make`, and `make install` the Postgres server as described in the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html). When the build completes, add the location of your `pg_config` file to your `PATH` variable:

  `export PATH=path_to_pg_config_file`

Then, move into the `spock` directory and build the Spock extension from source code. Before invoking `make` and `make install`, install the following package to meet spock prerequisites:

`sudo dnf [jansson](https://jansson.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/gettingstarted.html)`

Then, use a build process much like any other Postgres extension; you will need to: 

`make`

`make-install` 

Then, After initializing the database, update your `postgresql.conf` file, setting:

```bash
shared_preload_libraries = 'spock'
track_commit_timestamp = on # needed for conflict resolution
```

Then, connect to the database with psql, and use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to create the Spock extension:

  `CREATE EXTENSION spock;`


### Basic Configuration and Usage

!!! info

    pgEdge Distributed and Enterprise Postgres simplify installation and management of a distributed multi-master active-active replication cluster.  When deployed with pgEdge Postgres, replication clusters are automatically configured and deployed with Spock, ACE, Snowflake, and more.

If you're not deploying a cluster with pgEdge Postgres, you will need to configure your server to support logical decoding:

```sql
    wal_level = 'logical'
    max_worker_processes = 10   # one per database needed on provider node
                                # one per node needed on subscriber node
    max_replication_slots = 10  # one per node needed on provider node
    max_wal_senders = 10        # one per node needed on provider node
    shared_preload_libraries = 'spock'
    track_commit_timestamp = on # needed for conflict resolution
```

Also, you will need to configure your `pg_hba.conf` file to allow logical replication connections from localhost. Logical replication connections are treated by `pg_hba.conf` as regular connections to the provider database.

Then, use the `spock.node_create` command to create the provider node:

```sql
    SELECT spock.node_create(
        node_name := 'provider1',
        dsn := 'host=providerhost port=5432 dbname=db'
    );
```

Then, add the tables in the `public` schema to the `default` replication set.

```sql
    SELECT spock.repset_add_all_tables('default', ARRAY['public']);
```

Once the provider node is configured, you can add subscribers. First create the
subscriber node:

```sql
    SELECT spock.node_create(
        node_name := 'subscriber1',
        dsn := 'host=thishost port=5432 dbname=db'
    );
```

Then, create the subscription which will start synchronization and replication on the subscriber node:

```sql
    SELECT spock.sub_create(
        subscription_name := 'subscription1',
        provider_dsn := 'host=providerhost port=5432 dbname=db'
    );

    SELECT spock.sub_wait_for_sync('subscription1');
```

### Advanced Configuration Options for Spock

You can use the following configuration parameters (GUCs) on the psql command line with a `SET` statement or in a Postgres configuration file (like `postgresql.conf`) to configure a Spock installation.

#### `spock.allow_ddl_from_functions`

`spock.allow_ddl_from_functions` enables spock to automatically replicate DDL statements that are called within functions to also be automatically replicated. This can be turned `off` if these functions are expected to run on every node. When this is set to `off`, statements replicated from functions adhere to the same rule previously described for `include_ddl_repset`. If a table possesses a defined primary key, it will be added into the `default` replication set; alternatively, they will be added to the `default_insert_only` replication set.

#### `spock.batch_inserts`

`spock.batch_inserts` tells Spock to use batch insert mechanism if possible. The batch mechanism uses Postgres internal batch insert mode which is also used by `COPY` command.

#### `spock.channel_counters`

`spock.channel_counters` is a boolean value (the default is `true`) that enables or disables the Spock channel statistic information collection. This option can only be set when the postmaster starts.

#### `spock.check_all_uc_indexes`

!!! info

    This feature is experimental and `OFF` by default. Use this feature at your own risk.

This parameter enhances conflict resolution during `INSERT` operations in scenarios where a row  exists that meets unique constraints defined on the table (rather than primary keys or replication identity).

If this GUC is `enabled`, Spock will continue to check unique constraint indexes, after checking the primary key / replica identity index.  Only one conflict will be resolved, using Last-Write-Wins logic.  This includes the primary key / replica identity index. If a second conflict occurs, an exception is recorded in the `spock.exception_log` table.

Partial unique constraints are supported, but nullable unique constraints are not.
Deferable constraints are not supported, are filtered out and are not checked, and therefore may still cause an exception during the final commit.

Unique constraint indexes are checked in OID order, after the primary key.  It is therefore possible for the resolution of a unique constraint to change the primary key value.

Child tables / foreign keys are not checked or handled. Therefore, if resolving a unique constraint changes the primary key value, you can inadvertently create orphaned foreign key records.

#### `spock.conflict_resolution`

`spock.conflict_resolution` sets the resolution method for any detected conflicts between local data and incoming changes. Possible values are:

* `error` - the replication will stop on error if conflict is detected and manual action is needed for resolving
* `apply_remote` - always apply the change that's conflicting with local data
* `keep_local` - keep the local version of the data and ignore the conflicting change that is coming from the remote node
* `last_update_wins` - the version of data with newest commit timestamp will be kept (this can be either local or remote version)

To enable conflict resolution, the `track_commit_timestamp` setting must be enabled.

#### `spock.deny_all_ddl`

`spock.deny_all_ddl` is a boolean value (the default is `false`) that enables or disables the execution of DDL statements within a Spock configured cluster. This option can be set at postmaster startup, with the SIGHUP mechanism, or on the command line with SQL if you're a superuser.

#### `spock.enable_ddl_replication`

`spock.enable_ddl_replication` enables [automatic replication](managing/spock_autoddl.md) of ddl statements through the `default` replication set.

#### `spock.exception_behaviour`

Use this GUC to specify the commit behavior of Postgres when it encounters an ERROR within a transaction:

* `transdiscard` (the default) - Set `spock.exception_behaviour` to `transdiscard` to instruct the server to discard a transaction if any operation within that transaction returns an `ERROR`.
* `discard` - Set `spock.exception_behaviour` to `discard` to continue processing (and replicating) without interrupting server use. The server will commit any operation (any portion of a transaction) that does not return an `ERROR` statement.
* `sub_disable` - Set `spock.exception_behaviour` to `sub_disable` to disable the subscription for the node on which the exception was reported. Transactions for the disabled node will be added to a queue that is written to the WAL log file; when the subscription is enabled, replication will resume with the transaction that caused the exception, followed by the other queued transactions. You can use the `spock.alter_sub_skip_lsn` function to skip the transaction that caused the exception and resume processing with the next transaction in the queue.

Note that the value you choose for `spock.exception_behaviour` could potentially result in a large WAL log if transactions are allowed to accumulate.

#### `spock.exception_logging`

Use this GUC to specify which operations/transactions are written to the exception log table:

* `all` (the default) - Set `spock.exception_logging` to `all` to instruct the server to record all transactions that contain one or more failed operations in the `spock.exception_log` table. Note that this setting will log all operations that are part of a transaction if one operation fails.
* `discard` - Add a row to the `spock.exception_log` table for any discarded operation; successful transactions are not logged.
* `none` - Instructs the server to not log any operation or transactions to the exception log table.

#### `spock.extra_connection_options`

You can use the `spock.extra_connection_options` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file to assign connection options that apply to all connections made by Spock. This can be a useful place to set up custom keepalive options, etc.

`spock` defaults to enabling TCP keepalives to ensure that it notices when the upstream server disappears unexpectedly. To disable them add `keepalives = 0` to `spock.extra_connection_options`.

#### `spock.include_ddl_repset`

`spock.include_ddl_repset` enables spock to automatically add tables to replication sets at the time they are created on each node. Tables with primary keys will be added to the `default` replication set, and tables without primary keys will be added to the `default_insert_only` replication set. Altering a table to add or remove a primary key will make the correct adjustment to which replication set the table is part of. Setting a table to unlogged will remove it from replication. Detaching a partition will not remove it from replication.

#### `spock.save_resolutions`

`spock.save_resolutions` is a boolean value (the default is `false`) that logs all conflict resolutions to the `spock.resolutions table`. This option can only be set when the postmaster starts.

#### `spock.stats_max_entries`

`spock.stats_max_entries` specifies the maximum number of entries that can be stored into the Spock channel statistic. This option can only be set when the postmaster starts.  The parameter accepts values from `-1` to `INT_MAX` (the default is `-1`).

#### `spock.temp_directory`

  `spock.temp_directory` defines the system path where temporary files needed for schema synchronization are written.
  This path needs to exist and be writable by the user running Postgres. The default is `empty`, which tells Spock to use the default temporary directory based on environment or operating system settings.
