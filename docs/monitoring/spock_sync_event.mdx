## Using spock.sync_event to Confirm Synchronization

`spock.sync_event` enables event tracking and synchronization between a provider and a subscriber node in a Spock logical replication setup. You can use `spock.sync_event` to ensure that all changes up to a specific point (indicated by the PostgreSQL Log Sequence Number or LSN) on the provider have been received and applied on the subscriber. 

To mark the start of the sync event and return the LSN of the event on the subscriber node, you call a function on the node you have selected to act as a **provider node**:

`spock.sync_event()`

Then, you monitor a procedure on the node you have selected to act as the **subscriber node** that detects the presence of the LSN, and confirms when it has been received and applied:

`spock.wait_for_sync_event()`

**Synopsis**

Invoked on the **provider node**, this function returns the current pg_lsn` value, representing a point-in-time value for your replication scenario.  The syntax of `spock.sync_event` is:
 
`spock.sync_event() RETURNS pg_lsn`

Invoked on a **subscriber node**, `spock.wait_for_sync_event` is available in two flavors - the first uses the origin_id (an `oid`) as an identifier for the node, while the second uses the node name as an identifier:

- `spock.wait_for_sync_event(OUT result boolean, origin_id oid, lsn pg_lsn, timeout int DEFAULT 0)`

- `spock.wait_for_sync_event(OUT result boolean, origin_name, lsn pg_lsn, timeout int DEFAULT 0)`

This procedure waits on the subscriber node to alert you when the specified LSN (from the provider) is received and applied to the node.

Parameters:
`origin_id` or `origin_name`: Identifies the provider node.
`lsn`: The target LSN to wait for.
`timeout`: (Optional) Number of seconds to wait before timing out. The default is 0 (wait indefinitely).

Returns:
`result = true` – LSN has been received and applied.
`result = false` – Timeout occurred before the LSN was reached.

Example 

-- On a provider node:

`SELECT spock.sync_event();` 
`-- Returns: 0/16342B0 (example output)`

-- On a subscriber node:

`CALL spock.wait_for_sync_event(OUT result, 'provider_node', '0/16342B0', 10);`
`-- result: true (if applied within 10s), false otherwise`
