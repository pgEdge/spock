# Monitoring the Configuration and Health of Your Cluster

The Spock extension provides several ways you can monitor data health in your Postgres cluster:

* You can [query informational tables](../spock_ext/monitoring/spock_info.md) in the `spock` schema to review information about your cluster configuration and status.
* The Spock extension's [Lag Tracking](../spock_ext/monitoring/lag_tracking.mdx) utility allows you to review node-specific metrics for replication lag.
* Use Spock's [Sync Event](../spock_ext/monitoring/spock_sync_event.mdx) utility to watch for a specific transaction to replicate.
* Use the [ACE (Active Consistency Engine)](../platform/ace.mdx) to evaluate cluster health.
