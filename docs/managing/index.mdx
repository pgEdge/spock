# Managing a Spock Installation

The Spock extension is a powerful addition to any PostgreSQL installation; management features of the Spock extension allow you to seamlessly:

* [replicate partitioned tables](../spock_ext/managing/partition_mgmt.mdx).
* use [batch inserts](../spock_ext/managing/batch_inserts.mdx) to improve performance.
* create logical [row-based data filters](../spock_ext/managing/filtering.mdx).
* set a cluster to [READ-ONLY mode](../spock_ext/managing/read_only.mdx); this restricts non-superusers to read-only operations, while superusers can still perform both read and write operations.
* use a [trigger](../spock_ext/managing/repset_trigger.md) to manage replication set membership.
* use [Snowflake sequences](../spock_ext/managing/snowflake.mdx) for sequence management in a distributed cluster.
* enable [automatic DDL replication](../spock_ext/managing/spock_autoddl.mdx).
