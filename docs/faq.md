# Frequently Asked Questions

### Using a column filter

* What happens if I set up a column filter on a table with OIDS? Can I filter on xmin?

  Column filters work fine on tables with OIDs, but spock cannot filter on system columns like `oid` or `xmin`.

* What happens if a column being filtered on is dropped?

  Currently in spock replication, you can drop even a primary key on the provider.  If a column being filtered on is dropped on the provider, it is removed from the column filter too. Use `spock.repset_show_table()` to confirm this behavior.

  Columns on each subscriber remain as defined, which is correct and expected. In this state, the subscriber replicates INSERTs, but does not replicate UPDATEs and DELETEs.

* If I add a column, does it automatically get included?

  If you add a column to a table on the provider, it is not automatically added to the column filter.

### Using a row filter

* Can I create a `row_filter` on a table with OIDS? Can I filter on xmin?

  Yes, `row_filter` behavior works fine for table with OIDs, but spock cannot filter on system columns (like `xmin`).

* What types of functions can we execute in a `row_filter`? Can we use a volatile sampling function, for example?
  
  We can execute immutable, stable and volatile functions in a `row_filter`. Exercise caution with regard to writes as any expression which will do writes can potentially throw an error and stop replication.

  Volatile sampling function in `row_filter`: This would not work in practice as it would not get correct snapshot of the data in live system. Theoretically with static data, it works.

* Can we test a JSONB datatype that includes some form of attribute filtering?
 
  Yes, a `row_filter` on attributes of JSONB datatype works fine.

### Using apply_delay with time changes

* Does `apply_delay` accommodate time zone changes, for example Daylight Savings Time?

  There is a similar mechanism in physical replication - `recovery_min_apply_delay`. However, if you set an interval during daylight savings times, you might get that interval + the time change (in other words, you'll get a 1h delay instead of a 2h delay because of the time differential). This may lead to stopping and starting the database service twice per year.

  Yes, `apply_delay` accommodates time changes like Daylight Savings Time.  The value of `apply_delay` stays the same in practice, if a time shift happens after the subscription was created.  However, we do not recommend running heavy workloads during a time change as spock replication needs some time ( ~ 5 minutes) to recover.
