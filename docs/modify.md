# Modifying a Cluster

There are several ways to add a node to a cluster; the way that you choose should depend on the use and state of your cluster:

- [Manually Adding a Node with Zero Downtime](/docs/zodan.md) - details about using Spock functionality to add a node to a replicating cluster with zero downtime.
- [Adding a Node to a Replicating Cluster in Minimal Downtime](/docs/add_node_pgbackrest.md) - details about using pgBackRest to add a node.
- [Adding a Node to a Replicating Cluster with spockctrl](/docs/spockctrl.md) - using spockctrl to add a node with zero downtime.
