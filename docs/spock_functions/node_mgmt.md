# Node Management

Use commands listed in this section to manage the nodes in your replication cluster.

| Command  | Description
|----------|-------------
| [spock.node_create](functions/spock_node_create.md) | Create a `spock` node.
| [spock.node_drop](functions/spock_node_drop.md) | Drop a `spock` node.
| [spock.node_add_interface](functions/spock_node_add_interface.md) | Add an additional interface to a node.
| [spock.node_drop_interface](functions/spock_node_drop_interface.md) | Remove an existing interface from a node.


**Example:** Creating a Node

To create a node with Spock, connect to the server with psql and use the `spock.node_create` command:

`SELECT spock.node_create(node_name, dsn, location, country, info)`

* A name for the node.
* The dsn of the server on which the node resides.
* Connection information for your database.

**Note:** The DSN is similar to a connection string to the node youâ€™re creating. For example, the DSN to connect to the `acctg` database with an ip address of `10.1.1.1`, using credentials that belong to `carol` would be:

`host=10.1.1.1 user=carol dbname=acctg`.

The `location`, `country`, and `info` are all optional inputs to label nodes and have a default of `null`.

For example, the following command:

`SELECT spock.node_create(n1, `host=178.12.15.12 user=carol dbname=accounting`)`

Creates a node named `n1` that connects to the `accounting` database on `178.12.15.12`, authenticating with the credentials of a user named `carol`.

**Example:** Dropping a Node

To drop a node with Spock, connect to the server with psql, and use the `spock.node_drop` command:

`SELECT spock.node_drop(node_name, ifexists)`

* The name of the node.
* `ifexists` is a boolean value that suppresses an error if the node does not exist when set to `true` .

For example, the following command:

`SELECT spock.node_drop(n1, true)`

Creates a node named `n1` that connects to the `accounting` database on `178.12.15.12`, authenticating with the credentials of a user named `carol`.


## Node Management Functions

You can add and remove nodes dynamically with the following SQL functions.

### spock.node_create

**`spock.node_create(node_name name, dsn text)`**

Creates a replication node.

Parameters:

- `node_name` is the name of the new node; only one node is allowed per database.
- `dsn` is the connection string to the node. For nodes that are supposed to be providers, this should be reachable from the subscription nodes.

### spock.node_drop

**`spock.node_drop(node_name name, ifexists bool)`**

Drops a replication node.

Parameters:

- `node_name` is the name of an existing node.
- `ifexists` specifies the Spock extension behavior with regards to error messages. If `true`, an error is not thrown when the specified node does not exist. The default is `false`.

### spock.node_add_interface

**`spock.node_add_interface(node_name name, interface_name name, dsn text)`**

Adds an additional interface to a node.

When a node is created, the interface for it is also created using the `dsn` specified in the `create_node` command, and with the same name as the node. This interface allows adding alternative interfaces with different connection strings to an existing node.

Parameters:

`node_name` is the name of an existing node.
`interface_name` is the name of a new interface to be added.
`dsn` is the connection string to the node used for the new interface.

### spock.node_drop_interface

**`spock.node_drop_interface(node_name name, interface_name name)`**

Removes an existing interface from a node.

Parameters:

- `node_name` is the name of an existing node.
- `interface_name` is the name of an existing interface.
