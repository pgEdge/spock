# The Spock Extension

The Spock extension provides multi-master (active-active) replication for pgEdge Distributed and Enterprise Postgres, versions 15, 16, and 17. The extension leverages the pgLogical and Open Source project as a solid foundation to build upon for this enterprise-class extension.

The Spock extension is designed to support the following use cases:

* Asynchronous multi-active replication with conflict resolution
* Upgrades between major versions
* Full database replication
* Selective replication of sets of tables using replication sets
* Selective replication of table rows at either publisher or subscriber side (row_filter)
* Selective replication of partitioned tables
* Selective replication of table columns at publisher side
* Data gather/merge from multiple upstream servers

Note that:
* Spock works on a per-database level instead of a whole server level like physical streaming replication.
* One provider may feed multiple subscribers without incurring additional disk write overhead
* One subscriber can merge changes from several origins and detect conflict between changes with automatic and configurable conflict resolution (some, but not all aspects required for multi-master).
* Cascading replication is implemented in the form of changeset forwarding.

You build, install, and create the extension like any other Postgres extension.  For more information about using Postgres extensions, visit the Postgres [website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html).
