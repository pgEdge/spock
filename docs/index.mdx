# The Spock Extension

The Spock extension provides multi-master (active-active) replication for pgEdge Distributed and Enterprise Postgres, versions 15, 16, and 17. The extension leverages the pgLogical and Open Source project as a solid foundation to build upon for this enterprise-class extension.

You build, install, and create the extension like any other Postgres extension.  For more information about using Postgres extensions, visit the Postgres [website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-extensions.html).
