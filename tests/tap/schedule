# Tests, consuming too much time to be launched on each check:
#test: 011_zodan_sync_third
#
# Use GitHub Actions to launch them (see workflows/zodan_sync.yml for an example
# Also, it may be run locally by a bash script like the following:
#
# for i in {1..1000}; do
#    env PROVE_TESTS="t/011_zodan_sync_third.pl" make check_prove 1>out.txt 2>err.txt
#    status=$?
#    if [ $status -ne 0 ]; then
#        echo "make check failed with status $status on iteration $i"
#        break
#    fi
# done
